     <p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS for short, is a condition in which the ovaries produce an 
        excessive amount of androgens, which are male sex hormones that are normally present in small
        amounts in women. The term polycystic ovary syndrome refers to a condition in which the ovaries develop 
        a large number of cysts (fluid-filled sacs). However, a lot of women with this discorder do not develop cysts,
        whereas some women without the discorder do. The precise cause of PCOS is unknown. However,there are some 
        speculated causes such as high insulin levels. PCOS may also be passed down through families. It is not uncommon
        for sisters or a mother and daughter to have PCOS. Some symptoms of PCOS include: irregular periods. large ovaries,
        excessive body hair, weight gain, acne or oily skin, male-pattern baldness, infertility and dark/thin skin patches.</p><br></br>

        <h2> My personal battle with PCOS/</h2>

        <p> While going through puberty I noticed how irregular my periods were. Sometimes I would only have 3-5 periods for the 
            entire year. When I voiced my concern to my mother I was told "Your cycle is just sorting itself out. You're young it 
            is normal.". I accepted and believed this reasoning for many years throughout highschool, no matter how irregular or 
            painful my periods were. Until it got worse. Throughout my life my immune system has not been the strongest. I constantly 
            got sick or had sinus issues. In my last year of sixth form, I developed recurring tonsillitis. I noticed that every time
            I missed my period, my tonsils would get infected. Also, my periods got worse. I developed new period symptoms such as 
            stress eczema, cotton mouth, vertigo and excessive nausea. Something was obviously very wrong. One day I woke up and my 
            tonsils were severly infected, I had to go to the doctor immediately. During my doctor visit he asked when was the 
            last time I got my period I told him "Oh. Last year December." (this was in late february ). He was shocked at my nonchalance 
            and chided me for thinking this was normal. I quickly told him about my suspicion that my irregular cycle was linked to my 
            tonsillitis and he explained that sometimes hormonal imbalances may weaken your immune system. I was sent home with antibiotics 
            and a write-up for a ultrasound. I took his advice, visited a gynnaecologist and got an ultrasound. The gynnaecologist confirmed 
            it, I have PCOS. Honestly, I can say after the confirmation, life has been better. Of course at first I was inconsolable because
            the first symptom I saw when I researched it was infertility. However, after being prescribed birth control pills, my life really 
            has changed for the better. My periods come monthly, less severe period symptoms and my tonsillitis issues has stopped! Yes, I 
            still have some PCOS symptoms and this journey is still very hard, but I'm better than I was a year ago and for that I am grateful. 
            This is a battle I will not and cannot lose. PCOS- nil , Me-1.</p>
